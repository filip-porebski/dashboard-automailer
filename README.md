It is a macro that automatically connects to the current financial documents status report file on disk and displays it in an accessible way in the form of an e-mail. There is a graph and information about the distribution of invoices by type.

E-mail is sent to specific people who can be easily changed thanks to user-friendly userform. Additionally, the company can also be changed by selecting it from a list (in a separate sheet in an excel file you can create these lists).
